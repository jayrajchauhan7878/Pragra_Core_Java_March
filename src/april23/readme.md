Polymorphism 

compile time                        run time
static polymorphism             dynamic poly
method overloading                  method overriding

========================
Abstraction
========================

What an object does rather than how it does ?


iphone -------- interal working


car -----------we know how to drive , how engine works

Showing only essential features

1. Abstact class [0 to 100%]
2. Interfaces [100%] - < Java 7


Jav 8 and above --- interfaces have changed


1. Class has to declared with abstract keyword
2. if there is one or more abstract method in the class, class needs to be declared abstact
3. you cna not create an object of abstact class
