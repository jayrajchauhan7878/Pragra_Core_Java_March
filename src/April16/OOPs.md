=======================================

Object Oriented Java / Paradigm [OOPs]

=======================================


Functional programming -- functions are first class citizen






In java object oriented programming --- objects are first class citizen


Java has 
objects 
classes


**4 pillar of oops**
1. Inheritance
=========================
One class inherits from other class
**Properites(variables) and behaviour(methods)**


A   Variables,methods etc
|
B   inherit from A class

A   Parent class / super class / base class 
|
B   child class / derived class / subclass

Types of inheritance

Single --- Vehicle --- car
multilevel inheritance --- Vehicle --- car --- honda
hierachle clss --- 


Not supported - Multiple inheritance




2. Encapsulation

===============================
Data hiding , wrapping up the data in single unit.









3. polymorphism - many forms
==========================

method overloading......... same method name with different types of arrgument 
method overriding.......... 


method overloading vs overriding


4. abstraction 


abstact - showing only essential features but internal details / complexity



encapsulation                           abstraction

hiding everything                                   showing neccessary details

================================

Access Modifiers
=====================


1. Private --- It will be access within class only // your wifi
2. public --- It can be access throughtout project or aceess anywhere no restriction // starbucks
3. protected --- after inheritance 
4. default --- no keyword - if there is nothing than default
